# Poets Corner

## WillRenameHeader

I want to focus more on UI/UX of the app, I want  the layout to be flat/minimal like paper. Since it's strictly text based, I want to put emphasis on the typography, colours and overall layout of the app. For that I'll need to get the functionality out of the way whuch will include:

##### Functionality/Pages

1. Login/Register Page.
2. Home/Post Page.
3. Profile Page.
4. Edit Profile Page.

NoteToSelf: do not forget thought - "On home page will users have button [POST] which will redirect to seperate page to add content to post?"

do not forget reference - "Soundcloud Mobile Screenshot in gallery"

do not forget design idea - "Muted/Neutral Colours, rounded shapes and semi/bold fonts"



## Concept:

A social poetry app (text based). Users can share their own poetry or poetry that's already been written.

### Technical Information:

1. Users Can Login, Register.
2. Users Can post, like, comment.
3. Users can upload Profile Pictures.
