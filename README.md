# Collaborative Stories

## Concept 01

The goal of this social media app is to bring people together through collaborative story telling with a twist - 
A "Room" will be created and a specific amount of people can be invited to join - once their people have joined the room owner will roll the die and it will generate a random "Chapter Title" + a word limit (and some other key guidelines/details). Everyone will now write their own chapter relative to the chapter title and keeping the key elements within their story as well as sticking to the word limit (+- to make it easier maybe). Once everyone has published their part - and all snippets have read by everyone in the room - one chapter will be voted to "stay".

The Die will then be rolled again and new chapter title along with details of key elements + a word limit will be generated based on the number rolled (the die roll on the first go will never be the same as the die roll on the second row or any other row, each turn will have 6 completely different prompts) the process will repeat until they reach the final chapter -  the end result will be a story that contains different twists and turns aided by the roll of the die as well as different perspectives and writing styles made by a group of friends/writers

## Concept 02

Similair to the first concept but more complex - this version will require the Die to be used nore frequently - 
A room will be created with a specific amount of people. The admin will roll the die which will determine the "post" order, this will stay the same (highest goes first - lowest last and then repeat as the game goes on). The initial die roll will have determeined the post order for the entire game. 
For each go the user will have to roll the die which will give them a series of decisions they have to write about in detail - but making sure they stick to the flow of the story and passages that we're written before (keeping the consistency)
once the story is complete the world will be blessed with a new piece of collaborative fiction - Complete stories can be posted to the public so that other people can read and enjoy them or rate them as horribly as they've been written.
